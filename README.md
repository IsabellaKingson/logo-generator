# logo-generator

## Description

This is a way for users to generate a logo easily. A user can choose their desired text, text color, background shape, and background color, to have their logo instantly generated. Through this project I learned about object oriented programming, class constructors, modularization and inheritance. I also got to put my knowledge of jest to the test.
